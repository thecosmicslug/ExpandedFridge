# ExpandedFridge  + bugfixes
This project was forked from [https://github.com/Uwazouri/ExpandedFridge]

It now fully supports multiplayer & ginger island content,

I've added GenericModConfigMenu support, 

and it also contains UI Scale fix from 'SampaioTS' 

I work in visual studio code on linux, to build on other platforms may well need adjustments.

## Managing Mini Fridges
Access mini fridges through the kitchen fridge using inventory tabs.

Simply place mini fridges in a farm house or cabin with a kitchen and they will be accessible from the kitchen fridge.

The next day you will find your placed mini fridges moved away from your living space.

(They are placed in the first found free tiles within the house when the day ends so if the mod stops working you should still have your stuff!)

It should also work in multiplayer.


## Requirements:
- SMAPI 4.0+
- Stardew Valley 1.6+


## In-Game Instructions:
Place mini fridges inside a farm house or cabin with a kitchen.

Open the kitchen fridge to access any mini fridges in the location.

Use inventory tabs, mouse scroll wheel or game-pad shoulder triggers to switch between inventory pages (mini fridges).

(Optional) All mini fridges are moved in and out of the map bounds when day has started/before ending (on by default).

(Optional) Edit the "config.json" file in the "ExpandedFridgeAGAIN" folder to set hotkeys or hide mini fridges option.

(for keybindings and regarding the config file, see https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings)
